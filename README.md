# Keyless AI: Project Overview.

## Introduction

Keyless AI is an innovative personal assistant designed to orchestrate and execute on-chain transactions using an intent-based paradigm and a multi-agent network. It aims to simplify blockchain interactions for users by interpreting natural language intents and translating them into complex series of on-chain actions.

## Key Features

1. **Intent-Based User Interface**: Users interact with Keyless AI using natural language, describing their desired outcomes rather than specifying technical details.

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A network of specialized AI agents collaborates to interpret user intents and devise optimal execution strategies.

3. **Smart Account Integration**: Currently supports Coinbase smart accounts, allowing for secure and flexible transaction management.

4. **On-Chain Transaction Batching**: Efficiently bundles multiple operations into optimized transaction sets for cost-effective execution.

5. **Extensible Agent Ecosystem**: Designed to accommodate an expanding set of specialized agents for various blockchain operations.

## Core Components

### 1. Intent Parsing System
Translates user's natural language inputs into structured intents that can be processed by the multi-agent system.

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration System
Coordinates a team of specialized AI agents to collaborate on fulfilling user intents. Uses Autogen Group Chat for inter-agent communication.

### 3. Smart Account Interface
Integrates with Coinbase smart accounts, enabling secure transaction proposal and execution.

### 4. Transaction Batching and Execution Module
Compiles proposed actions from various agents into optimized transaction sets, manages user approval, and handles on-chain execution.

## Specialized Agents

1. **Send Tokens Agent**: Manages transfers of ERC20 tokens and ETH.
2. **Swap Tokens Agent**: Facilitates token exchanges across various decentralized exchanges.
3. **Bridge Tokens Agent**: Enables cross-chain token transfers.
4. **Token Research Agent**: Provides in-depth analysis of token metrics, market data, and trends.
5. **Staking Agent**: Manages yield-generating activities through various staking protocols.

## Workflow

1. User submits a natural language intent to Keyless AI.
2. The intent parsing system interprets the user's request.
3. A new Autogen Group Chat is created, bringing together relevant AI agents.
4. Agents collaborate, contribute expertise, and select appropriate tools to fulfill the intent.
5. As agents work, they add necessary transactions to a shared batch.
6. The compiled transaction batch is proposed to the user's smart account.
7. User reviews and approves the proposed transactions.
8. Keyless AI executes the approved transactions on-chain.

## Security Considerations

- Utilizes locally-stored private keys or MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallets for transaction signing.
- Implements a mandatory user approval step before any on-chain execution.
- Includes transaction simulation and gas estimation to prevent unexpected outcomes.
- Employs secure key management practices to protect user assets.

## Future Developments

- Integration with additional smart account providers beyond Coinbase.
- Expansion of the agent ecosystem to cover more specialized blockchain operations.
- Enhanced natural language processing for more complex and nuanced user intents.
- Implementation of AI-driven strategic advice for optimal transaction timing and execution.

## Conclusion

Keyless AI represents a significant step forward in making blockchain interactions more accessible and intuitive for users. By leveraging AI agents and intent-based interactions, it abstracts away the complexities of blockchain operations, allowing users to focus on their desired outcomes rather than technical details. As the project evolves, it has the potential to become a powerful tool for both novice and experienced blockchain users, streamlining complex operations and opening up new possibilities for on-chain activities.
